## The build environment is broken up into multiple parts:
#
#  * RootFS - Host-only tools such as `bash`, `make`, `cmake`, etc....
#  * BaseCompilerShard - Target-specific binutils, libc, etc....
#  * GCC - Target-and-ABI-specific GCC compilers
#  * LLVM - Target-nonspecific clang compilers
#
# Given a `Platform`, we determine the set of shards to mount in to the
# sandbox for that `Platform`.  If there are multiple possible options,
# (e.g. the Platform sets no ABI requirement) the oldest compiler possible 
# is used by default, for libstdc++ compatibility reasons.  (Even though we
# ship a very recent version of libstdc++ with Julia, we need to ensure that
# our binaries are as compatible as possible for custom builds)
#
# Each chunk of the build environment (referred to as a `shard`) is served
# as either a `.tar.gz` file or a `.squashfs` file.  While `.squashfs` files
# are desirable for multiple reasons (smaller download size, no need to unpack
# on the host filesystem taking up disk space) they currently require `sudo`
# privileges to mount on Linux machines, and as such cannot be used in the
# unprivileged user namespace setting, which is what we most often use.
# We therefore support downloading `.squashfs` files when a privileged
# usernamespace or qemu runnre is being used.
#
# Shards are downloaded to `<storage_dir>/downloads`, unpacked (in the case
# of `.tar.gz` files) to `<storage_dir>/mounts` or mounted to
# `<storage_dir>/mounts`.  We must take a little care when dealing with this
# mixture of unpacked and mounted shards (especially when switching Runner
# backends, as they will often cause the shard storage type to change!) but
# it's still desirable as it cuts down on the complexity of needing to change
# which paths are being mounted based on the archive type of the shard, etc...



# This is a type that encompasses a shard; it makes it easy to pass it around,
# get its download url, extraction url, mounting url, etc...
