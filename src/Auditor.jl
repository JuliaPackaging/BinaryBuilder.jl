# * Build dlopen() clone that inspects and tries to figure out why

Audits a prefix to attempt to find deployability issues with the binary objects
that have been installed within.  This auditing will check for relocatability
issues such as dependencies on libraries outside of the current `prefix`,
usage of advanced instruction sets such as AVX2 that may not be usable on many
platforms, linkage against newer glibc symbols, etc...

This method is still a work in progress, only some of the above list is
actually implemented, be sure to actually inspect `Auditor.jl` to see what is
and is not currently in the realm of fantasy.
