    Usage: build_tarballs.jl [target1,target2,...] [--help]

    Options:
        targets             By default `build_tarballs.jl` will build a tarball for every
                            target within the `platforms` variable.  To override this,
                            pass in a list of comma-separated target triplets for each
                            target to be built.  Note that this can be used to build for
                            platforms that are not listed in the 'default list' of
                            platforms in the `build_tarballs.jl` script.

        --verbose           This streams compiler and setup code output to `stdout`
                            during the build, which can help track down issues in your
                            build script.

        --debug=<mode>      This causes a failed build to drop into an interactive shell
                            for debugging purposes.  `<mode>` can be one of:
                              - `error` drops you into the interactive shell only when
                                there is an error during the build, this is the default
                                when no mode is specified.
                              - `begin` stops the build at the beginning before any
                                command in the script is run.
                              - `end` stops the build at the end of the build script,
                                useful to inspect a successful build for which the
                                auditor or some other packaging step would fail.

        --deploy=<repo>     Deploy binaries and JLL wrapper code to a github release of
                            an autogenerated repository.  `repo` should be of the form
                            `"JuliaBinaryWrappers/Foo_jll.jl"`.  The default behavior
                            of deploying to the local `~/.julia/dev` directory only can
                            be explicitly requested by setting `<repo>` to `"local"`.
                            Note there is no way to _not_ deploy; a JLL package will
                            always be generated.

        --register=<depot>  Register into the given depot.  By default, registers into
                            the first entry of `JULIA_DEPOT_PATH`, which is typically 
                            `~/.julia`.  Registration requires deployment to a non-
                            local target.

        --meta-json         Output a JSON representation of the given build instead of
                            actually building.  Note that this can (and often does)
                            output multiple JSON objects for multiple platforms, multi-
                            stage builds, etc...

        --help              Print out this message.

    Examples:
        julia --color=yes build_tarballs.jl --verbose
            This builds all tarballs, with colorized output.

        julia build_tarballs.jl x86_64-linux-gnu,i686-linux-gnu
            This builds two tarballs for the two platforms given, with a
            minimum of output messages.
